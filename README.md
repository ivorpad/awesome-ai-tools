- [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/agents/overview) - Framework for building AI agents with OpenAI models
- [Agent S](https://github.com/simular-ai/Agent-S) - Open-source framework for building autonomous GUI agents that can interact with computers, learn from experience, and perform complex tasks.


### Agent Memory
- [Mem0](https://github.com/Paige-AI/mem0) - Memory suite for LLM agents with multiple memory types


### Agent Observability, Evals
- [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) - Open Source LLM Engineering Platform for observability, evaluations, and user feedback

## Database Tools
- [Gen AI Toolbox for Databases](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gen-ai-toolbox-for-databases) - Server for connecting agent-based gen AI applications to databases

## OCR
- [Zerox](https://docs.getomni.ai/zerox) - Simple OCR tool that converts documents to markdown using vision models
- [RolmOCR](https://huggingface.co/reducto/RolmOCR) - Document OCR using the Qwen2-VL-7B vision language model (VLM)

## Document Intelligence
- [ExtractThinker](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/extractthinker) - Document intelligence tool that extracts structured data from documents using LLMs, functioning like an ORM
- [Docling](https://github.com/docling) - Providing seamless integrations with the gen AI ecosystem. Features include parsing multiple document formats, advanced PDF understanding, unified document representation, various export formats, local execution capabilities, plug-and-play integrations with LangChain/LlamaIndex/Crew AI/Haystack, extensive OCR support, and Visual Language Models support.

## Video Generation
- [Shotstack](https://shotstack.io/) - AI-powered video creation platform offering programmatic video editing, scalable rendering, and a white-label editor.

## Embeddings
- [Model2Vec](https://github.com/minishlab/model2vec) - Creates fast, state-of-the-art static embeddings by distilling sentence transformers into significantly smaller and faster models.

## Notebooks & Tutorials
- [Vision RAG with Gemini & Cohere Embed](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RdkYOTpx41WNLCA8BJoh3egQRMX8fpJZ?usp=sharing) - Colab notebook demonstrating RAG on rich multimedia files (PDFs with graphics) using Gemini 2.5 and Cohere Embed v4, avoiding complex image-to-markdown steps.
- [Infinite Retrieval: Attention Enhanced LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12962) - A breakthrough technique that helps AI process extremely long documents (up to 1 million tokens) without special training or external tools. By analyzing how AI focuses on text (its "attention"), this method enables perfect information retrieval from massive documents using even smaller AI models.
- [Advances and Challenges in Foundation Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01990) - Comprehensive survey of intelligent agents within a brain-inspired architecture, exploring modular foundations, self-enhancement mechanisms, collaborative multi-agent systems, and safety considerations for real-world deployment.

## Web Scraping
- [Scrapling](https://github.com/scrapling/scrapling) - High-performance, intelligent web scraping library for Python that automatically adapts to website changes and bypasses anti-bot protections. Features include stealth browsing, automatic CSS selector matching, and Playwright integration.

## Documentation
- [Context7](https://context7.com/) - Up-to-date documentation for LLMs and AI code editors. Copy the latest docs and code for any library â€” paste into Cursor, Claude, or other LLMs.

## LLM Utilities & Calculators
- [VRAM & Performance Calculator](https://apxml.com/tools/vram-calculator) - Estimate VRAM and performance requirements for LLM inference and fine-tuning, including quantization, KV cache, and hardware configuration options.
